# Challenge Fulltimeforce

This project is my challenge submission. It was built using node.js and nest.js for back end and react for front end.

## How to install and run this project.

To run this project, the easiest way is to open two CLIs and move to this projects directory on both of them. You should find two folders: "back" and "front".

### Back

On one terminal you should move to the folder named "back". The next step is to run `npm install` so all dependencies will be installed.

Once the installation is complete, run `npm start`. This script will run the backend app in your computer.

Done! You can now go on and run the frontend app, remember to keep the terminal you used open.

### Front

On the other CLI you should move into the folder named "back". As you did previously, install all react dependencies by running the following script: `npm install`.

After the installation is complete, run `npm start`. This script will run the front end app in development mode so you can try it.

The app runs on port 3000, so you can open your browser, go to "localhost:3000" and you should see the app. 

That's it!
